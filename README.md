## Introduction
Clustering is a technique used in machine learning and data analysis to group similar data points together. There are several clustering algorithms available, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. In this project, we compare the performance of the following clustering algorithms:

- K-Means
- Hierarchical Clustering
- DBSCAN

## Algorithms
### K-Means
K-means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that aims to partition data points into K clusters. The algorithm works by first selecting K random points as centroids and then iteratively assigning data points to the closest centroid and updating the centroid position. The algorithm terminates when the centroids no longer move significantly.

### Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is a bottom-up clustering algorithm that creates a dendrogram to represent the relationships between data points. The algorithm starts by treating each data point as a separate cluster and then repeatedly merges the closest pairs of clusters until only one cluster remains.

### DBSCAN
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are closely packed together. The algorithm works by selecting a random data point and finding all the neighboring data points within a specified radius. The algorithm continues to expand the cluster by adding neighboring points until there are no more neighboring points within the specified radius.

## Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of each clustering algorithm, we use the following metrics:

- Silhouette Score
- Davies-Bouldin Index
- Calinski-Harabasz Index

### Silhouette Score
The Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The score ranges from -1 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates that the object is well-matched to its own cluster and poorly-matched to neighboring clusters.

### Davies-Bouldin Index
The Davies-Bouldin Index measures the similarity between clusters and the distance between clusters. The index ranges from 0 to infinity, where a lower score indicates better clustering.

### Calinski-Harabasz Index
The Calinski-Harabasz Index measures the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. The index ranges from 0 to infinity, where a higher score indicates better clustering.
